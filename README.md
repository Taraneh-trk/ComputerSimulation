#  Computer Simulation – University Course

This repository contains the assignments, simulation models, and projects I completed as part of the *Computer Simulation* course at university.

The course focuses on modeling real-world systems using computational techniques, analyzing system behavior, and implementing simulations using programming tools and mathematical logic.

Here’s an improved and professional version of your description in English, suitable for a `README.md`:

###  Repository Structure

The files in this repository are organized into two main parts:

1. **Exercises 1 to 5** cover the **fundamentals of computer simulation**.
   These include basic exercises, either implemented in Python or answered as handwritten solutions.

2. The **midterm project** is based on the material from Exercises 1 to 5.

3. **Exercises 6 to 10** involve solving problems using the **Arena simulation software**, based on the textbook
   *"Simulation with Arena, 6th Edition"*.

   * The naming convention for these solutions follows the format:
     `chapterNumber-questionNumber`

     * `chapterNumber`: the chapter number from the textbook
     * `questionNumber`: the exercise number at the end of that chapter

4. The **final project** builds upon all exercises from 1 to 10, combining both foundational simulation concepts and Arena-based models.
