#  Computer Simulation â€“ University Course

This repository contains the assignments, simulation models, and projects I completed as part of the *Computer Simulation* course at university.

The course focuses on modeling real-world systems using computational techniques, analyzing system behavior, and implementing simulations using programming tools and mathematical logic.
